Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation of the air sacs in one or both lungs, with the possibility of them filling with fluid or pus. This can cause coughing with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Bacterial and viral pathogens are the two primary causes of pneumonia, each requiring a different form of treatment, such as antibiotics for bacterial and supportive care for viral. The WHO reports that pneumonia kills around 2 million children under five every year, with a majority of cases seen in developing countries in Southeast Asia and Africa. The use of radiographic data such as chest X-rays is essential for diagnosis, and rapid interpretation of images is necessary in order to provide urgent intervention. To this end, the effectiveness of transfer learning frameworks for classifying pediatric chest X-rays to detect pneumonia and differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia is being studied, so as to facilitate rapid referrals to those in need.<br />

The WHO states that pneumonia kills around 2 million children under five annually, outnumbering deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. A majority of new cases are reported in the developing countries of Southeast Asia and Africa. Bacterial and viral pathogens are the two primary causes of pneumonia, each requiring a different form of treatment - antibiotics for bacterial and supportive care for viral. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential, which involves the use of radiographic data such as chest X-rays to differentiate between the different types of pneumonia. However, in low-resource settings, rapid interpretation of images is not always available. Therefore, the effectiveness of transfer learning frameworks in classifying pediatric chest X-rays to detect pneumonia and differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia is being investigated to facilitate rapid referrals to those in need of urgent intervention.<br />
# Dataset
Data used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
This dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). It consists of 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). The chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were taken from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou. These images were checked for quality control and graded by two expert physicians before being used to train the AI system. The evaluation set was also checked by a third expert to account for any grading errors.<br />
# Model
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is commonly used in image recognition and processing tasks. It is composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons that process and analyze visual data. CNNs are designed to take advantage of the spatial structure of data, such as the arrangement of pixels in an image. They use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. This means that the network is able to learn directly from raw input data, such as images or audio samples. Each layer in a CNN processes a different part of the input data, and the output of each layer is passed on to the next layer in the network. This hierarchical structure allows the network to learn complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.
One key feature of CNNs is the use of convolutional layers, which apply a specified number of filters to the input data. These filters are designed to detect specific patterns or features in the data, such as edges, corners, or textures. The output of the convolutional layer is a set of feature maps, which are used as input for the next layer in the network. By using multiple convolutional layers and pooling layers, a CNN is able to learn increasingly complex features of the input data at each layer. The final layers of the network are typically fully connected layers, which combine the learned features to make a final prediction. CNNs have been very successful in a wide range of applications, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. They have also been used in natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis and machine translation.<br />
In my project I create convolutional neural network using the Keras API, I tried three models using different architectures and changing the parameters and the number of hidden layers,please check the code to find out more.
